Welcome to kwoncy's repos.

I'm looking for a job. If you have any information, please let me know I appreciate it. this address would be better : aimakercy24@gmail.com

Now I try to make my own app using recently developped AI models.
My app should include various ai model such as small llm, object detection and Image Enhancement.

You can see my journey through waves of errors on the above folder named error_history. In there, I solved monumental problem about building library.



## here's my project as a AI Engineer

* making realtime lightweight hybrid detector model on my own and adapt ort training technology on it 
  - https://github.com/kwoncy2020/ort_training (currently not on public for security reason)
    - hybrid detector, onnxruntime, onnx, on-device training
      
* inference quantized model on mobile with c++ using hardware accelerators such as snapdragon npu, mobile gpu, 8bit model on cpu
  - https://github.com/kwoncy2020/tflite_dlc_for_android (currently not on public for security reason)
    - qualcomm snpe sdk, tflite hexagon, nnapi delegates

* xcode object detection (barcode, qrcode, mpcode, pdf417, dmtx) based on mobilenet model and remake the model, dataloader ; also rearrage training strategies 
  - https://github.com/kwoncy2020/ssd-pytorch-qfgaohao (currently not on public for security reason)
    - pytorch, tensorflow lite c, c++, opencv, pyqt, bazel, android ndk, 


* auto detect stroke in dysarthria patients voice ( custom model consists of custom resnet and custom transformer - model2.py )
  - https://github.com/kwoncy2020/dysarthria_stroke_auto_detection
    - tensorflow, librosa
    
* nystagmus tool for helping the project named "nystagmus auto detection" 
  - https://github.com/kwoncy2020/nystagmus-tool
    - pyqt5, tensorflow, opencv, numpy, matplotlib
    
* nystagmus auto detection on medical video 
  - https://github.com/kwoncy2020/nystagmus_auto_detection
    - tensorflow, scikit-learn, opencv, numpy, matplotlib

* nystagmus tool with mfc (this is just a temporal project due to its development time. you can see how to connect tensorflow model made by python to c++)
  - https://github.com/kwoncy2020/load-tensorflow-model-on-cplusplus-with-opencv
    - c++, mfc, opencv, tensorflow, pytorch


*** 
## my personal project
* my first flutter app
  - https://github.com/kwoncy2020/my-first-flutter-app
    - flutter, dart, GetX, Hive

***
## my amature personal project before becoming a developer
* image processing practice tool
  - https://github.com/kwoncy2020/image-processing-practice-tool
    - pyqt5, pywin32, tesseract, opencv, numpy, etc.
* my first simple web app ( before it comes to 1 year, I erased aws account. so no longer available on aws gateway)
  - https://github.com/kwoncy2020/my-first-web-app
    - javascript, react.js, opencv-react, material-ui, styled-component, etc.

***
## additional skills
* 빅데이터분석기사 (National Technical Qualification - Engineer of Big data Analysis)
  - scikit-learn, pandas
* 정보통신기사 (National Technical Qualification - Engineer of Information communication)
* 정보처리산업기사 (National Technical Qualification - Industrial Engineer of Information Processing)

***
### I have been studying skills of web as well in my personal interests ( mobile development would be later )
* gatsby.js ( to make SPA ), nest.js with typescript ( to make backend )
